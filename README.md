tl;dr: if it keeps inside oauth2/dc api its safe, which is this case
(just dont somehow manage to spam it like 300+ times/minute lol)

### **it is still against tos but not bannable as long as ^^**

### prep
uhh discord.js-self and chalk so just do
```npm install discord.js-self chalk```
then at sh**.json replace "ur token" with your token (i promisse by everything this is not a stealer aaaa)

replace "the server to be cloned's id" with the server to be cloned's id and

"the destiny server's id" with the destiny server's id

### usage
just ```node idk.js``` after everything and you're done w

small project so dont expect it to be good

it was intended to non admin users so yeah
